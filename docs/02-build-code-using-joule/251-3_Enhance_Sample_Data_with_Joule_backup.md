# SAP Build Code and Joule Copilot

## Create Sample Data with SAP Joule

In this lesson, we will utilise the generative AI capabilities of Joule
and SAP Build Code to generate sample data. This data will be used to
test and preview the backend service of our customer loyalty program
application.

1. In the Joule panel, select the command **/cap-gen-data**

2. Copy and paste the following Prompt into Joule and select Generate:

    ```
    Generate realistic sample data for the entities as follows:

    Customers: Create 5 customers. All customer numbers will
    be 7 digits and one customer must use the customer number 1200547. No
    field may be empty. Total purchase value must be smaller than 10000.
    Total reward points and total redeemed reward points both must be
    unround and different and always sum to one-tenth of total purchase
    value for each customer.

    Purchases: Generate 5 purchases of electronic office products. Each 
    ‘purchaseValue’ will be between 50 and 1000. Ensure that each 
    ‘rewardPoints’ is always one-tenth of the ‘purchaseValue’. Ensure 
    that the ‘customer’ field is populated with a key from the Customers table.

    Redemptions: Generate 5 redemption records. Ensure that each redeemed 
    amount is different and between 10 and 100. Ensure that the ‘customer’ 
    field is populated with a key from the Customers table.
    ```

4. **Copy and paste** the following Prompt into Joule and select Generate:

    ```code
    Enhance my sample data with meaningful data. Any phone numbers must be 10 digits. All customer numbers must be 7 digits and one customer must use the customer number 1200547. No fields may be empty. Total purchase value must be smaller than 10000 und unround. Total reward points and total redeemed reward points both must be unround and different and always sum to one-tenth of the total purchase value for each customer. Be also assure that no fields are empty. Especially check that CreatedBy fields are enhanced with respective data
    ```

5. Select **Accept** to approve the sample customer data generated by Joule.
. You can see the customer names, email adresses, createdBy and purchases are created. Accept the new Sample Data created by Joule.

6. Verify in the customer list that one customerNumber was changed to **1200547**, if not change one customer number manually to **1200547**. 

    **This step is needed for the demo purpose. Later in the exercise, we will be scanning a Customer Loyalty Card that will have a barcode with this number.**
